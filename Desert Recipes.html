<li>Combine the butter and chopped chocolate in a double boiler and melt over low heat, stirring until smooth. Alternatively, place the butter and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high, stirring every 30-seconds until melted.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt. Beat on medium speed until thick and pale yellow.</li>
<li>Add the melted chocolate mixture and flour into the egg mixture.</li>
<li>Fold together the mixture until well combined.</li>
<li>Transfer the batter into the prepared ramekins. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the sides of the cakes are firm set, but the center is jiggly. Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Place a small dessert plate over the top of each ramekin and carefully flip it over, inverting the chocolate lava cake onto the plate. Let stand for about 10 seconds, then remove the ramekin to unmold the cakes. Sift powdered sugar on top and garnish with berries, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>

<h2><center><b><u>CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT</h2></center></b></u>

<ol>
<li>Prepare the chocolate ganache by simmering the cream and pouring it over the chocolate. Leave for 2 minutes and then stir until you get a nice, shiny, homogenous ganache.</li>
<li>Prepare the hazelnut mousse by mixing the mascarpone cheese with powdered sugar until creamy. Add the hazelnut spread and combine well. Then pour in the cold cream while mixing the mascarpone with an electric mixer at medium speed. Mix the mousse only until it can slightly hold shape. Don’t over-mix the mascarpone and cream because this mixture can easily split.</li>
<li>Crush the hazelnut wafers into smaller bits and set aside.</li>
<li>Assemble the dessert in a glass or a mason jar by alternating between the ganache, mousse and wafers. Set in the fridge for 2 hours and then decorate with whipped cream and other toppings.</li>

<h2><center><b><u>BROWNIE</h2></center></b></u>

<ul>
<li>2 eggs + water – Michelle uses a bit of water with the eggs to achieve the moist, gooey texture of boxed mix brownies without any commercial emulsifiers. And because this recipe doesn’t contain any baking powder, eggs are essential for helping the brownies puff up in the oven.</li>
<li>Powdered sugar – The trick to making homemade brownies that are just like ones from a box! Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken the batter without the chemical additives you’d find in a mix.</li>
<li>Unsweetened cocoa powder – Michelle recommends using Hershey’s Special Dark Dutch-processed cocoa powder (I used Whole Foods’ 365 Cocoa Powder). Make sure to sift it if it’s lumpy!</li>
<li>Oil – While many recipes for brownies use unsalted butter, Michelle’s calls for canola oil, just like the boxed mix. I use olive oil because it’s what I keep on hand, and I love the rich flavor.</li>
<li>Vanilla Extract – 1/2 teaspoon vanilla really amps up the chocolate flavor.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one</li>
<li>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick</li>
<li>Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li>
<li>Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. They also freeze well for up to a month. Last time I made these, I doubled the recipe and stored the second batch in the freezer. It was so fun to have them on hand for a quick and easy dessert or afternoon treat!</li>

<h2><center>Funnel Cake<b><u></h2></center></b></u>

<ul>
<li>Flour. Regular, all-purpose flour works. Do NOT use self-rising flour.</li>
<li>Milk. Pretty much any kind will work, but my preference is whole milk. You may need more milk than I call for to get your batter to the right consistency, I’ve never needed more than 1 cup but enough people have mentioned that they’ve needed to add more in their own kitchen that I like to mention that it’s OK to add more liquid if needed!</li>
<li>Vanilla extract. This is optional, but it will make your funnel cakes taste sweeter and richer.</li>
<li>Powdered sugar. For sprinkling on top. The more the merrier!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How to Make Funnel Cake</p></b>
<ol>
<li>Whisk the dry ingredients until combined.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients, then gradually stir in the dry ingredients until the batter is smooth and no large lumps remain.</li>
<li>Heat 2-3″ of oil over medium-low until it reaches the proper temperature, then slowly drizzle a thin stream of batter in a zig-zag pattern into the hot oil.</li>
<li>Fry on each side until golden brown, then remove to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
<li>Dust your funnel cake with powdered sugar and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
