<br>
<img src="C:\Users\sai jayprakash sarak\OneDrive\Desktop\matarpaneer.JPG"width="300px" height="300px" style="float:right;cursor:pointer;">
<p>The recipe is extremely simple and easy to prepare with basic ingredients to make premium curry.
 Yet some simple and critical tips to make it more perfect are –
<ol>
<li>Fresh Ingredients – The 2 key ingredients, i.e. Paneer and peas have to be fresh and moist.
Homemade moist paneer is 
highly recommended with fresh peas over frozen ones. Also, try to use flavored and 
fresh aromatic spices to get the best result.</li>
<li>Gravy Base – The ideal and authentic way to prepare the gravy base is to make it 
with finely chopped tomatoes and onions.These are sauteed till mushy and then blended to a smooth paste.
 Avoid using canned tomato puree and canned white onions.</li>
<li>Cream vs. Yogurt – The texture and the creaminess of the gravy base arrive with the addition of dairy 
products like cream or curd (yogurt). However, the addition of cream makes it super tasty as yogurt can make it sour or tangy in taste.</li>
<li>Experiment – The recipe can be experimented with to have additional vegetables with the matar and paneer. However, it should not supersede
 the 2 main ingredients. You may add sliced carrots, mushrooms, and even capsicums.</li>
<li>Simmer Slowly – The important tip to get the best flavor and taste is to cook the tomato onion gravy base in slow to medium heat. 
The oil should start oozing out which means the base is perfectly cooked and ready to take paneer and matar in it.</li>

<OL>
<li> First heat 1 tablespoon butter or oil in a pan or kadai. Make sure that the butter does not brown. 
So melt the butter on a low heat.</li>
<li>Then add 1 cup Kaju or 120 grams whole cashews.</li>
<li>Stir and saute the cashews till they become golden on low to medium-low heat.</li>
<li>Remove them on a plate and keep them aside.</li>
<li>In the same pan there will be some butter remaining. Add 1 tej patta (Indian bay leaf) 
and saute for a few seconds on low heat.</li>
<li> Then add 1.5 cups roughly chopped tomatoes and ½ cup water. About 4 medium or 3 large sized tomatoes. 
Stir and mix well and
 simmer the mixture on a medium to high heat till the tomatoes soften. 
You can also cover the pan and cook the tomatoes.</li>
<li> When the tomatoes are simmering, take 18 to 20 cashews in a grinder or blender.</li>
<li>Powder them to a very fine texture. If fat is released while grinding or blending cashews, then it is alright. Scrape the sides and powder them finely.</li>
<li>Remove and keep the ground cashews aside.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the tomatoes have softened. Switch off the heat and allow the tomatoes to become warm or cool down completely.</li>
<li>Discard the tej patta and add the tomatoes to the same grinder or blender jar in which we had ground the cashews.</li>
<li>Blend the tomatoes into a smooth puree. Keep aside.</li>
<li>In the same pan in which we sauteed the cashews and cooked the tomatoes, heat 2 tablespoons of butter on low heat.
Add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste (1 inch ginger + 3 to 4 garlic crushed to paste in a mortar-pestle).
Stir and saute for some seconds or till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
<li>Stir till the color of the cashew powder changes to a pale light golden and you get a nice aroma. However don’t brown the cashew powder.Then add the prepared tomato puree.</li>
<li>Then add ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder or deghi mirch. Stir and mix very well.
Now add ⅔ to ¾ cup water or as required. Stir and mix again.</li>
<li>Then add the sautéed golden cashews. Stir. You can also keep a few cashews for garnish.Season with salt as required.</li>
<li> Lastly add the following ingredients:</li>
<ul>
<li>½ teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
<li>2 to 3 tablespoons low fat cream or light cream or cooking cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons whipping cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kasuri methi, crushed (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
