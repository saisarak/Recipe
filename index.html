<p><font face="Bookman old style" size="4">A recipe is a formula of ingredients and a list of instructions for creating prepared foods. It is used to control quality, quantity, and food costs in a foodservice operation. A recipe may be simple to complex based on the requirements of the operation and the intended user. For example, an experienced chef may need a recipe with only a few details, while a beginner cook may need more information about ingredients, preparation steps, cooking times and temperatures, visual cues, and equipment requirements. 

Recipes are formatted differently depending on the author and the intended use. Professional chefs record recipes in pocket notebooks, binders, or digital devices, using simple to complex details, depending on the type of recipe and the experience level of the chef.  Information might include ingredients, prep steps, kitchen notes, and hand-drawn plate presentations. Recipes for the general consumer must be written with the assumption that the intended user knows very little about food preparation. When writing recipes that others will use in your kitchen, provide as much information as possible so that anyone who is preparing, inexperienced or skilled, can easily understand. Include information on ingredients, prep steps for fabricating or measuring, cooking instructions, recipe yield, and required equipment.</p></font>

<h1><b>What is a recipe and its purpose?</h1></b>
<p><font face="Bookman old style" size="4">A recipe is simply defined as a set of instructions with a list of ingredients used to prepare a particular food, dish or drink. People use recipes to replicate foods they enjoy that they otherwise do not know how to make. Chefs use recipes to make sure a dish tastes the same each time it is ordered.

To develop a good recipe, it should be tested to ensure consistent and reliable outcomes, regardless of the person following the recipe instructions. With a properly written recipe, its ingredients and serving size are exact and measured accurately. Based on this information, a nutrient analysis can be done to evaluate the nutrition content of the dish, which is important information for some.</p></font><br><br><br><br>
<h1><font style="ALGERIAN" size="6">The 5 Rules of Cooking</h1></font><br>
<ul>
<li>Start with the best ingredients possible. Will this make your food taste better? Definitely. Great cooks produce fabulous meals because they use quality ingredients. Sure, a good recipe can produce good results, but your dish will taste only as good as the ingredients that go into it. So get rid of old, expired spices; frequent your local farmers’ market; find a good butcher and fishmonger; buy good olive oil. You’ll taste a difference.</li>
<li>Read the entire recipe before you begin. This may sound obvious, but even seasoned cooks will jump into a recipe without reading it first (yep, I’ve been guilty, too), only to discover midway that they’re missing a key ingredient or that something needs to marinate for several hours. These types of surprises can quickly derail your cooking plan but are easily avoided by reading the recipe ahead</li> 
<li>Prep ingredients ahead of time. Mise en place is a French term that means “everything in its place.” This is how professional kitchens run, and for good reason. Getting all your ingredients prepped and gathered in one place before you start cooking cuts down on mistakes, creates efficiency, . and reduces stress. As one culinary instructor explained it to me, “Prep the dish until you can’t prep it anymore.”</li>
<li>Keep on cooking. You can’t become a good cook without some flops along the way. If your dish fails, don’t despair; consider it a learning experience on the path to being a better cook. Failures happen to everyone, even accomplished cooks, so don’t give up—and remember, takeout is just a phone call away.</li>
<li>Invest in a good knife. A chef ’s knife is the most indispensable tool in the home kitchen. It’s the knife you’ll use most to chop, dice, slice, mince, smash, carve, and more, so it’s worth it to buy a good one. Caring for it and keeping it sharp is also important, not only for ease of use, but also because a sharp blade is safer than a dull one. Compensating for a dull blade by adding extra force can be dangerous.</li>
</ul>
