<img src="C:\Users\sai jayprakash sarak\OneDrive\Desktop\masala dosa.JPG"width="300px" height="300px" style="float:right;cursor:pointer;">
<p><b>Make Batter</p></b>
<ol>
<li>First take all the ingredients in three bowls. Note that these ingredients are easily available online or 
 any Indian or Asian grocery store if you live outside India.</li>
<li>1.5 cups idli rice or parboiled rice in one bowl. You can also use regular short-grained to medium-grained rice like sona masuri or parmal.</li>
<li>½ cup urad dal (husked black gram) + 1 tablespoon chana dal (husked and split bengal gram) + 20 methi seeds (fenugreek seeds) in a second bowl</li>
<li>⅓ cup thick poha (flattened rice) in a third bowl.</li>
<li>Rinse the lentils and fenugreek seeds a couple of times. Then soak them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
<li>Before grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils+fenugreek seeds and keep it for grinding urad dal. You can also use fresh water if you prefer.</li>
<li>Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the lentils or ½ cup of fresh water if you like.</li>
<li>Grind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the dosa batter ferments well.</li>
<li> Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava (cream of wheat) like consistency of the ground rice grains.Now pour the rice+flattened rice batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad lentil batter.</li>
<li>Add ½ teaspoon edible rock salt or add as per taste. You can also use sea salt or pink salt.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Fermented Batter</b></p>
<p>Mix the salt very well with the ground batter. Also, mix both the rice batter and the urad lentil batter thoroughly. Cover with a lid and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours at room temperature.
You can keep for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city. It can take anywhere from 6 hours to a day or more for it to ferment.
In the Indian summers, the batter ferments quickly and during winters it takes a longer duration of time.A well fermented batter will double or triple in volume, have a pleasant sour aroma with many tiny air-pockets.
Once your batter is nicely fermented, cover and refrigerate it when you start to make the potato masala stuffing. In hotter seasons, the batter kept at room temperature will continue to ferment and will become very sour.</p>
<p><b>Make Potato Filling</p></b>
<ol>
<li>First rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker.
You can also boil potatoes in a pan or in an Instant pot. The potatoes have to be completely cooked and fork tender.</li>
<li>Then peel and chop them. Also, thinly slice 2 medium to large onions (200 grams) and chop 1 to 2 green chilies, finely chop 1 inch ginger and some coriander leaves. When you measure, you should have
1.25 cups thinly sliced onions
1 teaspoon chopped green chillies
1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger
3 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves</li>
<li>Heat oil or ghee in a frying pan or skillet. If using cashews, then fry 2 tablespoons cashews at this step and keep them aside.
Lower the heat and add mustard seeds and let them splutter. You can add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds while tempering.</li>
<li>add the sliced onions, curry leaves, green chilies and ginger Add the turmeric powder and asafoetida (hing).Mix very well.Next add the boiled chopped potatoes.Mix very well. You can choose to mash the potatoes slightly while cooking.</li>
<li>Season with salt according to taste. Also add ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar for a slightly sweet taste. Stir and keep the potato masala aside. The potato filling should be moist and easily spreadable on the dosa. Make sure there is no water in the potato stuffing. It should not be of a curry or gravy consistency. </li>
<p><b>Make Masala Dosa</p></b>
<ol>
<li>Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter with an increase in its volume.</li>
<li>eat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don’t smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won’t be able to spread the batter easily.
Dosa batter has a medium-thick to medium flowing consistency and is easily pourable.</li>
<li>Keep the heat to a low, while spreading batter Spread the batter in a circular way on the pan. On a medium heat, cook the dosa.  Sprinkle some oil on top and edges. Cover the dosa with a lid and let it cook.</li>
<li>Cook till its base becomes golden and crisp. You can spread the oil which was sprinkled earlier on the dosa with a spoon.
You can also opt to flip the dosa and cook the top side.</li>
<li>When you see the base has become golden, the edges have separated from the pan and the dosa has cooked, place a portion of the potato masala filling on the dosa. Now fold the dosa and serve.</li>
</ol>

<h2><center><b><u>APPAM</h2></center></b></u>
<img src="C:\Users\sai jayprakash sarak\OneDrive\Desktop\appam.JPEG"width="300px" height="300px" style="float:right;cursor:pointer;">
<p><b>Make Palappam Batter</p></b>
<ul>
<li>First rinse 1.5 cups regular white rice (like sona masuri, parmal, surti kolam, or ponni rice) in water a few times. Then soak the rice with 2 cups of water in a bowl for 4 to 5 hours. While soaking cover with a lid.</li>
<li> Drain all the water and discard it. Add the drained, soaked rice to blender or grinder jar. Also add ½ cup grated fresh coconut, ¼ cup poha (flattened rice), ½ teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons sugar.</li>
<li> ¾ cup water (or as needed) and blend or grind the ingredients to a smooth and fine flowing batter.
If in case, the batter looks thin, add a few tablespoons of rice flour to thicken it slightly.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Leaven the Batter</p></b>
<ol>
<li>Transfer the batter in a medium to large mixing bowl. Now you have two options when it comes to yeast. I have made this recipe many time with both the types of yeast.With Instant yeast, the recipe just gets made quicker as the leavening and fermenting time reduces. I have included instructions for both.</li>
<ul>
<li>If using Dry Active yeastMix ½ teaspoon dry active yeast first in 1 to 2 tablespoons of lukewarm water. Add this yeast solution to the batter and mix well. Cover and allow to ferment for 8 to 12 hours, depending on the temperature conditions. The batter will rise and double up the next day.</li>
<li>If using Instant Yeast Add ½ teaspoon Instant yeast (rapid rising yeast). I have used instant yeast here.yeast sprinkled atop appam batter in bowl</li>
</ul>
<li>Mix thoroughly so that the fine yeast granules dissolves in the batter. Cover and set aside to ferment for 1 to 2 hours. You can also use the instant pot to ferment the batter.stirring to dissolve the yeast</li>
<li>After leavening with instant yeast, this is how the batter should look. It will double in volume and you will see air-pockets 
everywhere.I had to leaven the batter for a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes as it was a warm climate this day. 
A cooler weather will take more time.properly fermented dough in a mixing bowl - it has doubled in size and has lots of air pockets</li>
<p><b>Make Appam</p></b>
<ul>
<li>Heat an appam pan or a seasoned kadai/wok with handles. Sprinkle about ½ teaspoon oil on the pan and spread it all over on the pan. If using nonstick kadai, then skip smearing the oil.
The appam pan or appachatti works best as you get soft fluffy texture in the center and crisp texture towards the circumference. Spread a ladle full of the batter (about ¼ to ⅓ cup) into the hot pan.appam batter in heated pan</li>
<li>Turn and tilt the pan in circles so as to spread the batter into a round circle.
Regulate the heat as needed. If the pan becomes too hot, the batter cooks faster and you won’t be able to make a neat round batter with thin edges and a soft center. So you can reduce the heat or place the pan on the countertop and then pour the batter.wirling dough around pan to create a round appam
<li>Make a neat round circle of the batter. Keep the heat to medium-low or medium.batter looks thin and lacy in the pan lid atop pan on the flam</li>
 <li>Appam goes very well with vegetable stew and sweetened coconut milk. I like to serve them with both! It can also be served with veg korma or potato stew.</li>

<li>Grind to a coarse paste or semi-fine, but do not puree. Transfer the paste to a bowl or plate and keep aside.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Make Tomato Puree</p></b>
To the same blender, add 3 large ripe and red chopped tomatoes.You will need 275 grams tomatoes or roughly 1.5 to 1.75 cups chopped tomatoes.Blend the tomatoes to a smooth puree. For a beautiful bright red rasam, you can first blanch the tomatoes and then puree them.</li>
<p><b>Fry Spices & Herbs</p></b>
<ol>

<img src="C:\Users\sai jayprakash sarak\OneDrive\Desktop\vadasambar.WEBP"width="340px" height="300px" style="float:right;cursor:pointer;">
<p><b>Make vada</p></b>
<ol>
<li>For making vada, soak urad dal for 2 to 3 hours. For best results, I keep inside fridge after 2 hours for an hour minimum before grinding. This gives fluffy batter.</li>
<li>Drain water completely and grind to a smooth paste by adding little ice cold water or ice cubes at a time.
Once smooth transfer to a mixing bowl.</li>
<li> Heat oil, grease your hands with water and make a small ball out of vadai batter.Move the ball to fingers and make a hole in the center with your thumb.</li>
<li>Drop in hot oil by inverting your hands over oil and gently moving your fingers.Cook in medium flame both sides until golden and crisp. Maintain oil temperature by regulating the heat, otherwise it will drink oil.</li>
<li>Drain in paper towel. Soak the vada in hot water. Add little salt in the water. Let it get soaked.</li>
<p><b>Prepare sambar</p></b>
<ol>
<li>For sambar, pressure cook toor dal with 1 & ½ cups of water for 4 whistles in medium flame.
Once done, mash it well. Add turmeric, red chilli, finely chopped tomato, peeled small onion, slit green chillies, curry leaves, tamarind extract.
Soak tamarind in hot water for ½ hour and extract juice with a cup of water.</li>
<li>Pressure cook for a whistle. In a kadai, splutter mustard and lower the flame. Add sambar powder and quickly give it a stir.</li>
<li> Add the pressure cooked dal mixture to it.Mix well and adjust water consistency.
You may have to add 1 & ½ cups water to 2 cups approximately.
Bring to boil and add coriander leaves, asafoetida powder, jaggery or sugar and top with ghee. Switch off the flame.</li>
<li>Now gently squeeze the excess water in the soaked vada, without changing its shape and arrange in the serving bowl.
Add hot sambar over it. Garnish with finely chopped onions before serving.</li>
